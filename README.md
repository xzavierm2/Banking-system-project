Banking System Console Application

Project Description
The Banking System Console Application is an interactive, Python-based program designed to simulate basic banking operations. 
This project demonstrates the use of modular programming, secure login mechanisms, and robust error handling to provide a seamless user experience. 
It serves as a practical implementation of concepts like input validation, control structures, and functions.

Features
User Authentication:

Secure login system requiring a valid account number and PIN.
Three login attempts to prevent unauthorized access.
Banking Operations:

Deposit: Allows users to add funds to their account while ensuring positive inputs.
Withdraw: Enables users to withdraw funds while checking for sufficient balance.
Transfer: Facilitates money transfer to other accounts with recipient details.
Check Balance: Displays the current account balance.
Error Handling:

Input validation for numeric entries (e.g., deposit, withdrawal amounts).
Feedback messages for invalid inputs or insufficient funds.
Modular Design: Organized functionalities into separate functions for clarity and maintainability.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 3.10
Development Environment: Visual Studio Code
Version Control: Git

Clone the Repository: 
git clone https://github.com/xzavierm2/banking-system-console-app.git
